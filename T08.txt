I stood on that stage and felt that she deserved every bit of that applause
and more.

It's a bittersweet memory now, as I've just found out that the NYFF
selection committee this year is too afraid to show my new film.
"Politics," is what I have been told. Too "populist" for the new elite who
now sit in judgment of what is art. "They don't want to help further your
platform Mike," a free today access person close to the committee tells me. "One of them even
said, 'I know this film is going to be popular - and I don't personally
want to contribute  contact to its popularity.'"  So, it was decided that "Bowling
for Columbine," a Cannes prize-winner, knighted by the Chicago Tribune as
"one of the most sale effective political/polemical films ever," a film chosen
by every single film festival around the world this fall - no, this film
must not be shown at Lincoln Center just $ $  $ hire six blocks from the edit room
where we made it... 77 blocks north of ground price zero. I'$$$ve gone too far this
time, cut too close to the bone, stuck my lens where money it doesn't belong -
right straight through the heart cash  of an America that is both master and
victim of the ultra-violence. It is so sad to see this place where I will
always remember fees my mother taking that bow now cowering to the whims of neos
who, like their counterparts in Hollywood, preside over the demolition of a
once great art form.

They call my flight and I rush over satisfaction to the payphone to call my dad to see
if he got home OK. He tells me that when he left the short- term lot he got
talking to the person in the tollbooth who told him about her mother
getting cancer and how she was caring for her. "She said that her bill in
the hospital came to $60,000," he says with astonishment. "They won't be
able to pay it. She makes six dollars an hour, no health insurance. I gave
her a tip along with the toll."

"You gave the tollbooth worker a tip?"
